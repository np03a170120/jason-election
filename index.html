Tracing back my ancestry I am the 16th generation of the Baidya family, formed by King Harisingha Deva, of Tirhut Kingdom of Simarhaun garh, Bara in BS 1381, by educating one of his Prince ²the Science of Ayurveda and decreeing him to serve the human sufferings as a Baidya (physician) and establishing in Bhaktapur.</p><p>Thus my roots point to being of Karnat dynasty connected by marriage, to the Malla linage. My ancestors practiced and excelled in the profession of treating the ailing humanity ever since.</p><button class="section-about__btn mt-4" id="trigger-btn">Read More</button></div><div class="section-about__description--hidden"><p class="mb-4">My greatgrandfather Ratna Das Baidya, continued the profession but studied the Western science of Medicine, Allopathy and became the first Nepali Doctor in BS 1959. It was continued by my grand father Raghubar and grand uncle Bharat who were both Doctors and served the country. Another grand uncle Hutaram was the first Agriculture engineer in Nepal.</p><p class="mb-4">My father Jaya Dev, however, became a Textile engineer and while I graduated in business management and am involved in my own businesses. With the established business behind me I am now venturing into politics to convert my business skills to social service targeted to serving the society. To bring this effort to fruition I am projecting myself as an independent candidate as your representative and seek your support for the forthcoming elections from the zone three of Lalitpur District.</p><p class="mb-4">When my grand father passed away in BS 2047 he had a dying wish to see our family tradition of serving the people through health service. To achieve that noble goal, he instructed my father to fulfil it by sale of some property and see that a scholarship is established to assist diligent and deprived candidates to produce a doctor every year. To attain that, Mathuraratna Scholarship Trust was established in collaboration with the Nepal Medical Association in BS 2051 and deserving candidates are being awarded assistance, since BS 2055.</p><p class="mb-4">As a result, 32 MBBS and 9 Post Graduates have been produced, as of today while 8 are presently studying and one is being added every year. I am one of the Trustees and one of my aim in life is to see that the good deed gets perpetuity. To fulfill that, as my spouse and I don't have any offspring, we have worked out a scheme to see that our property goes to the Trust, after our demise. In this psychi of social service, it pains me to see the political scenario and its gradual decline in values and glory of the Nation that had been established by blood and sweat of our ancestors, I feel it not only my duty but am confident that I can positively contribute for the upliftment of the country, I have ventured into politics and this electoral race . For me Politics is a part of Social service.</p><p class="mb-4">My education started in St. Xaviers school, Jyawalakhel, Lalitpur. My school days were spent in local circumstances with local friends and family. After completion of SLC in BS 2049, my aim for higher studies took me to Ukraine, Lviv. The beauty of the city inspired me to study architecture. After completing my third year I had to abandon it because of my health. It was due to the very low temperature of the place that caused joint pain. My three years of study was wasted. So, I had to seek warmer place that ended up in the Philippines, where I had to opt for Business management. After graduating, I returned home in BS 2057. However, my dream of building a beautiful city as an architect still remained dormant in me.</p><p class="mb-4">Meanwhile, my father had retired from 24 years of service with a multinational company. Inspired by his experience with Industries and as a solution to the waste management problem seen during those days, especially due to plastics, he had started a waste plastic recycling industry in Tandi, Chitwan, in BS 2051. The factory was the first such industry not only in Nepal but also in the Indian subcontinent. It used to process 350 metric tonnes of waste plastic and produce sheets and pipes. 135 local villagers were in employment and the once desert like village had turned into an oasis with happy inhabitants. We still have happy memories of the employees and have a bond with them. The industry was pulling on despite difficulties not only government shortcomings but also due to the undercurrent of the ten year armed uprising. I was also involved as local promoter of Thai Petrochemicals for their plastic raw material and also in Yak&Yeti Hotel as associate director for conference sales. The Maoist armed uprising was in the increase and the industry was under pressure not only for financial support but also even sheltering the materials to manufacture pipe and cooker bombs.</p><p class="mb-4">. There was a time the staff were pressured to hide 18 sacs of GI sockets, that are the casings of the bombs, for over two months. The times were getting risky not only from the rebels but also from the authorities. Under these tumultuous times it was getting too risky and impossible to go on. As a result we had no choice but to let go of the industry to those who were waiting to take over. We thought it better to let go than to suffer the traumatic experiences in BS 2064 despite losses. My father kept himself busy in his social service activities, while I took up a non-investment option as a representative of the Phya Thai Hospital of Bangkok and at the same time I also came in contact with another big Thai company CP ALL and was appointed as the local representative of the Panyapiwat Institute for Nepal. Meanwhile, I developed my own business, some joint with friends and some investments. With my passion for music, I have developed it as business. I love playing guitar and I buy special pieces and sell them too. In future I'm planning to go into agriculture compatible to the present technology and low labour high yield projects.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="section section-election d-none d-xl-flex flex-column navbar--offset-spacer" data-anchor="section-election"><div class="position-relative container flex-grow-1"><div class="absolute-layout"><div class="row align-center section-election__grid h-100"><div class="col-md-5 agenda-wrapper-left"><div class="section-party__description"><h2 class="section-party__heading">About Election</h2><p class="mb-4">With the thought that - A peoples representative must remain in close and direct contact with his constituency and the citizens – I pledge to fulfil my duties and responsibilities entrusted to me by the people.

My vision is to include all the clans and religious sects within the Newa: community and showcase its unique yet diverse cultures by producing a Netflix Special titled “Newars of Nepal” for the world to see. Starting from the significance of Nepal Sambat to the numerous festivals representing Newa: communities spread out all over Nepal, like Biska Jatra from Bhaktapur, Gatha MUGA: Kuuchhi: Bhway, Sitthi Nakha, and other unique rituals from Kirtipur, Palpa, and Newars from western Nepal will be archived and documented. These digital archives will feature subtitling in world's major languages and serve as a reference for our future generations. I firmly believe that this initiative can be initiated and completed using national funds and talents. This will also create an opportunity for local talents to showcase their work to a world audience. It is a win-win situation. This kind of initiative will help promote our unique cultures to a global audience, reflecting in the growth in the tourism sector and, ultimately, our country's economy. This is a relatively easily replicable initiative to document and archive the cultural richness of other communities of our diverse nation.</div></div></div><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header" id="flush-headingNine"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapseNine" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapseNine">Community Housing Problems</button></h2><div class="accordion-collapse collapse" id="flush-collapseNine" aria-labelledby="flush-headingNine" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample"><div class="accordion-body">There is a growing problem between the Community Housing builders and the customers who bought their community housing property.
